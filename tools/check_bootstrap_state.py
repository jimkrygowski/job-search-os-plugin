"""Bootstrap-completeness check, used by the SessionStart hook (session_start.py).
Flags missing or incomplete setup before Claude's first reply.

Checks the workspace's career/profile.md, trajectory.md, and comp_target.md and
injects at most one note, naming which required sections are missing or
empty. This is a presence check, not a sufficiency judgment: it only
asks whether each required section has *something* written under its
heading, not whether that content is actually good. This hook runs as a
plain subprocess before Claude's turn starts -- it has no LLM available
to judge whether content is substantive, so it doesn't try. That
judgment belongs entirely to the skill that actually reads the file when
a user engages with it (build-profile/define-trajectory/offer-
negotiator's own Session Start checks), which is where it happens
correctly.

- profile.md missing or has empty/missing required sections: hard-gate
  new-user note (must lead the first reply), naming which sections.
- profile.md complete (by presence), trajectory.md complete,
  comp_target.md missing or has empty/missing required sections: soft,
  non-blocking note, naming which sections.
- All three complete: no note.
